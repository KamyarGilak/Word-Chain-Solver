# Word-Chain-Solver
Two words are connected by a word chain if it is possible to change one into the other by making a series of single-character changes, such that every intermediate form is also a word.  For example, CAT and DOG are connected with a word chain because CAT, COT, COG and DOG are all words. DEMONIC and UMBRELLA are not.
